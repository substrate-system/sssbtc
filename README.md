# Shamir's Secret Sharing

A user-friendly web/GUI implementation of Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS),
optimized for Bitcoin and BIP-39 mnemonics.

This project provides a browser-based GUI that allows users to
split BIP-39 mnemonics into `M`-of-`N` shards using the
**SLIP-39 standard**. The goal is to be the best UX for key backups.
